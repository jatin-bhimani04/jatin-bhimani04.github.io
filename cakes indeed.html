                <q>We initially chose Claudia’s due to the location. It was very close to our wedding venue. From the initial contact to the delivery, everything was great. We chose 2 different layers/flavors: almond raspberry & strawberry champagne. Both were incredibly delicious and our guests were coming back for seconds!</q>

                <q>Our Wedding Cake turned out exactly as we had requested and the flavors were delicious! We selected the Strawberry Champagne flavor with Queenies Icing and it was amazing! We also ordered a sheet of the white almond and it was a big hit as well. Highly recommend using Claudia’s for your next event!</q>
